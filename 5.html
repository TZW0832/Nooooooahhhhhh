<h2>Dialectical Notebook1</h1>
<p>“They are. And they are, for the most part, done with the world. You are not. You’re alive, Bod. That means you have infinite potential. You can do anything, make anything, dream anything. If you change the world, the world will change. Potential. Once you’re dead, it’s gone. Over. You’ve made what you’ve made, dreamed your dream, written your name. You may be buried here, you may even walk. But that potential is finished.” (The graveyard book p.179)
 When a person is in a state of despair or does not have close family or friends around, they may think negatively and even contemplate suicide. However, life is so precious and we only have one chance at it. There are so many things that a living person can do that a dead person cannot. People may often wonder about the value of life or the purpose of living, but they overlook the potential or capabilities of humans. In my opinion, people do not need to be fixated on one goal. As long as they live happily and do the things they want to do, that is a valuable and meaningful life.</p>

“See the world”, said Bod. “Get into trouble. Get out of trouble again. Visit jungles and volcanoes and deserts and islands. And people, I want to meet an awful lot of people.”( the graveyard book: p306)

I believe that one of the most important values of being human is to bear witness. To appreciate all kinds of people and things, whether it's nature, humanity, or oneself, and to witness the changes that are happening or have happened with our own eyes. I admire Bod's courage to face and try new things, a trait that is precious and rare, and perhaps it's because his comfort zone is in the graveyard since childhood that he desires to leave and witness the world he has never seen before. But that's a good thing. Because we must continue to learn, whether through action or our senses.</p>
